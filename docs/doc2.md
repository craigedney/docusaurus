DocHub uses  [**Github Flavored Markdown (GFM)**](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling. This will enable all documentation to be written to an industry standard.

**Markdown Headers**

Documents use the following markdown header fields that are enclosed by a line --- on either side:

* `id`: A unique document id. If this field is not present, the document's id will default to its file name (without the extension).
* `title`: The title of your document. If this field is not present, the document's title will default to its id.
* `sidebar_label`: The text shown in the document sidebar and in the next/previous button for this document. If this field is not present, the document's sidebar_label will default to its title.

For Example:

```javascript
---
id: docID
title: myTitle
sidebar_label: myLabel
---
```
